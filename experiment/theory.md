### Introduction

Understanding human genetic variations using advanced technologies provide an insight to the genetic makeup of an individual and the way in which their genes are expressed, regulated, and modified. Genetic variation refers to the natural differences that exist between individuals within a population in terms of their DNA sequence. Genes are the inherited DNA segments that contain protein-coding information which transform from one generation to the next. Genetic studies reveals that most of the variation occurs in Germ cells and somatic cells. Variation that arises in germ cells can be inherited from one individual to another and so affect population dynamics, and ultimately evolution. Two important scientific term that commonly used in a genetic study is variant and alleles. The term variant is referred to a specific region of the genome which differs between two genomes whereas different versions of the same variant are called alleles. Alleles are the key factor determining the features which can be passed from parents to children.

Genetic variation is the fundamental source of natural selection as it enhances or reduces the frequency of alleles. The variations in genetic material is beneficial in some cases as it allows the certain population dynamics to adapt and survive in the changing environmental arena. Genetic variations occurs mainly due to mutations and genetic recombination.


•	Mutations are changes that occur in the DNA sequence, either spontaneously or as a result of exposure to mutagens, such as radiation or chemicals. Mutations can be beneficial, harmful, or neutral, depending on the location and nature of the change (Fig.1).

•	Genetic recombination occurs during meiosis, the process by which cells divide to produce eggs or sperm. During meiosis, homologous chromosomes exchange genetic material, resulting in new combinations of alleles (variants of genes) in the offspring.

Genetic variation is responsible for the differences we see between individuals in terms of physic.al traits, such as height, eye color, and skin color. It also plays a crucial role in disease susceptibility and drug response. Understanding genetic variation is essential for medical research, as it helps scientists develop personalized medicine and therapies that can be tailored to individual patients based on their genetic makeup. Genetic variation studies also aid on evolutionary studies, forensic investigations, and agriculture and animal breeding.

### Genetic Variation Databases	

A genetic variation database is a collection of data on genetic variants in a particular population or species. The database provide a standardised framework to describe variants associated with specific trait. The database typically includes information on the location, frequency, and functional impact of genetic variants. It also include annotations on the clinical significance of genetic variants, such as their associations with different diseases and the level of evidence supporting these associations.

Genetic variation databases can be useful for a variety of purposes, including research, clinical diagnosis, and drug development. For example, researchers may use genetic variation databases to identify genetic variants that are associated with specific diseases or traits, and to understand the genetic basis of these conditions. Clinicians may use genetic variation databases to interpret genetic test results and to make more informed decisions about patient care. Drug developers may use genetic variation databases to identify drug targets and to develop personalized treatments that are tailored to an individual's genetic makeup. These databases are typically maintained by government agencies, research institutions, or private companies, and are freely available to researchers, clinicians, and the public. Various bioinformatics databases were available for handling large amount of genome-scale data. Some of them are:

•	1000 Genomes Project: This project was designed to catalog genetic variations in the genomes of over 2,500 individuals from around the world.

•	ExAC: The Exome Aggregation Consortium database contains information on genetic variations found in the exomes of over 60,000 individuals.

•	gnomAD: This database contains information on genetic variations found in over 140,000 exomes and 15,000 whole genomes.

•	dbSNP: This is the largest public database of genetic variations, containing information on over 151 million variations.

•	ClinVar: This database focuses on genetic variations that are known to be associated with human disease. It contains information on over 500,000 variants.


These databases are valuable resources for researchers and clinicians who are studying human genetics and working to develop new treatments for genetic diseases. They allow researchers to compare genetic variations across populations, identify new disease-associated variants, and better understand the underlying mechanisms of genetic diseases.

### Insights to dbSNP and ClinVar Database

#### Single Nucleotide Polymorphism database:

dbSNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism database) is a public database maintained by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), a division of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). It is one of the most widely used databases for human genetic variation. The dbSNP database contains information about genetic variations that occur in the human genome, including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), small insertions and deletions (indels), and larger structural variations. (Fig.3) It also includes information about the frequency of these variations in different populations, their functional effects, and their associations with various diseases.

The database is regularly updated and currently contains information on more than 150 million genetic variations, making it one of the largest and most comprehensive resources for studying human genetic variation. The data in dbSNP are derived from a variety of sources, including research studies, public databases, and commercial genotyping arrays. One of the main uses of dbSNP is to facilitate the identification of genetic variations that are associated with disease. Researchers can use the database to search for known disease-associated variants or to identify novel variants that may be associated with a particular disease. The database can also be used to study population genetics and human evolution, as it contains information on the frequency of genetic variants in different populations around the world.

dbSNP is freely available and can be accessed through the NCBI website. It is a valuable resource for researchers in the fields of genetics, genomics, and medicine who are interested in studying human genetic variation and its impact on health and disease.

#### ClinVar (Clinical Variation) Database:

ClinVar is a public database of genetic variants and their associations with human diseases. It is maintained by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), a division of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).(Fig.4) The database is a collaborative effort involving many organizations and institutions, including clinical labs, research centers, and patient advocacy groups. ClinVar contains information about the clinical significance of genetic variants, including their associations with different diseases, the level of evidence supporting these associations, and the interpretation of their impact on human health. The database also includes information about the frequency of these variants in different populations, and whether they are benign, likely benign, uncertain significance, likely pathogenic, or pathogenic. ClinVar is an important resource for researchers, clinicians, and patients who are interested in understanding the genetic basis of human diseases. It allows users to search for genetic variants of interest and to view information about their clinical significance and interpretation. It also provides a platform for submitting new data and evidence about genetic variants, which can help to improve the accuracy and completeness of the database.

One of the main uses of ClinVar is to support clinical decision-making in the diagnosis and treatment of genetic diseases. Clinicians can use the database to identify genetic variants that are associated with specific diseases, and to determine the clinical significance of these variants. Patients can also use the database to better understand their genetic risks and to inform their healthcare decisions. The database is freely available and can be accessed through the NCBI website. It is a valuable resource for anyone interested in studying the genetic basis of human diseases, and for improving the accuracy and completeness of genetic variant interpretation.
